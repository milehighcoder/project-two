## Description

Managers are often tasked with creating schedules for their team of employees on a weekly or bi-weekly basis. This application accomplishes two things. It makes it easy for managers to create and manage their employee's schedules. It also allows employees to view their schedules, clock in and out, request a schedule change, and request vacation time.
